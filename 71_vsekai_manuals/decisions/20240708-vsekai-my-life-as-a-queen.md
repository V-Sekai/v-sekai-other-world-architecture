# Proposed: V-Sekai: My Life as a Princess

## The Context

> Welcome to the second Godot XR Game Jam!
>
> This game jam is organized by the Godot XR Community and offers a fun opportunity to build something using Godot's XR capabilities.
>
> Godot XR offers a lightweight entry into making XR games. With the expected release of Godot 4.3, there are loads of improvements, especially around AR-related features.
>
> The theme for this game jam is: **Relaxation!**

## The Problem Statement

Create an Android XR game using the theme of "Relaxation" and utilizing Godot Engine 4.3 with our module for goal hierarchical task network planner and our portable avatar import format (VRM).

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

In "V-Sekai: My Life as a Princess," players assume the role of a princess tasked with rebuilding and managing a kingdom. The game focuses on relaxation through planning, resource management, VR interactions, and adventurer tasking.

- **Main Menu**: A serene landscape with options to start a new game, load a saved game, and access settings.
- **In-Game HUD**: Minimalistic interface showing resources, current tasks, and a map of the kingdom.
- **Kingdom View**: A top-down view of the kingdom where players can place buildings, gardens, and other structures.
- **Adventurer Management Screen**: Interface to manage and send adventurers on quests.

### Initial Prototype

```gdscript
var memories: Dictionary = {
    "is_at": {"player": "cabin"},
    "is_outside_of": {"cave entrance": "cabin"},
    "contains": {"first_room": "treasure"}
}

var todo_list: Array = [
    "Explore the cabin",
    "Find the cave entrance",
    "Enter the cave",
    "Reach the treasure room"
]
```

You start in a little cabin in the woods. You have a cave you can venture into, and at the end is treasure. This initial prototype serves as a simple introduction to the game's mechanics and environment.

### Initial Prototype Reversal

```gdscript
var strategic_memories: Dictionary = {
    "is_at": {"princess": "royal cabin"},
    "has_goal": {"princess": "retrieve treasure from the cave"},
    "preparation_status": {"princess": "not_started"}
}

var strategic_plan: Array = [
    "Set goal to retrieve treasure from the cave",
    "Ensure adventurer is prepared for the journey"
]

var tactical_memories: Dictionary = {
    "is_at": {"adventurer": "adventurer's cabin"},
    "knows_location": {"adventurer": ["adventurer's cabin", "cave entrance"]},
    "route_planned": {"adventurer": false}
}

var tactical_plan: Array = [
    "Move adventurer to the adventurer's cabin",
    "Locate the cave entrance",
    "Plan route through the cave to the treasure room"
]

var operational_memories: Dictionary = {
    "is_at": {"adventurer": "adventurer's cabin"},
    "visited": {"adventurer": []},
    "contains": {"first_room": "treasure"}
}

var operational_plan: Array = [
    "Walk to the adventurer's cabin",
    "Search for the cave entrance",
    "Enter the cave",
    "Navigate to the first room",
    "Collect the treasure"
]
```

In the initial prototype, you explore the cave yourself. In "V-Sekai: My Life as a Princess," you will reverse this concept by taking on the role of the princess who supplies adventurers with instructions to explore the cave and retrieve treasures. This shift from direct exploration to strategic management aligns with the relaxation theme.

## The Benefits

- **Relaxing Gameplay**: Focuses on non-combat activities like building, gardening, organizing events, and sending adventurers on quests.
- **Immersive Experience**: Utilizes VRM technology for customizable avatars and Godot's XR capabilities for an engaging experience.
- **Dynamic Task Management**: The HTN planner ensures that tasks are generated based on player actions, providing a unique experience each time.

## The Downsides

- **Learning Curve**: Players unfamiliar with resource management games may find it challenging initially.
- **Hardware Requirements**: Requires a VR-capable device, which may limit accessibility.

## The Road Not Taken

- **Combat Mechanics**: Instead of focusing on relaxation, we could have included combat elements, but this would detract from the theme of relaxation.
- **Linear Storyline**: A fixed storyline could have been implemented, but dynamic task generation offers more replayability.

## The Infrequent Use Case

- **Seasonal Events**: While the game includes various activities, seasonal events such as festivals or special quests tied to real-world holidays are not included. These could add variety but would require additional development time and resources.

## In Core and Done by Us

- **Core Development**: The V-Sekai development team will handle all core aspects of the game, including coding, art, and design.
- **Community Contributions**: Open to contributions from the Godot XR community for additional content and features.
