# Proposed: V-Sekai: My Life as a Queen

## The Context

Welcome to the second Godot XR Game Jam!

This game jam is organized by the Godot XR Community and offers a fun opportunity to build something using Godot's XR capabilities.

Godot XR offers a lightweight entry into making XR games. With the expected release of Godot 4.3, there are loads of improvements, especially around AR-related features.

The theme for this game jam is: **Relaxation!**

## The Problem Statement

Create an Android XR game using the theme of "Relaxation" and utilizing Godot Engine 4.3 with our module for goal hierarchical task network planner and our portable avatar import format (VRM).

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

In "V-Sekai: My Life as a Queen," players assume the role of a queen tasked with rebuilding and managing a kingdom. The game focuses on relaxation through planning, resource management, VR interactions, and adventurer tasking.

- **Main Menu**: A serene landscape with options to start a new game, load a saved game, and access settings.
- **In-Game HUD**: Minimalistic interface showing resources, current tasks, and a map of the kingdom.
- **Kingdom View**: A top-down view of the kingdom where players can place buildings, gardens, and other structures.
- **Adventurer Management Screen**: Interface to manage and send adventurers on quests.

## The Benefits

- **Relaxing Gameplay**: Focuses on non-combat activities like building, gardening, organizing events, and sending adventurers on quests.
- **Immersive Experience**: Utilizes VRM technology for customizable avatars and Godot's XR capabilities for an engaging experience.
- **Dynamic Task Management**: The HTN planner ensures that tasks are generated based on player actions, providing a unique experience each time.

## The Downsides

- **Learning Curve**: Players unfamiliar with resource management games may find it challenging initially.
- **Hardware Requirements**: Requires a VR-capable device, which may limit accessibility.

## The Road Not Taken

- **Combat Mechanics**: Instead of focusing on relaxation, we could have included combat elements, but this would detract from the theme of relaxation.
- **Linear Storyline**: A fixed storyline could have been implemented, but dynamic task generation offers more replayability.

## The Infrequent Use Case

- **Seasonal Events**: While the game includes various activities, seasonal events such as festivals or special quests tied to real-world holidays are not included. These could add variety but would require additional development time and resources.

## In Core and Done by Us

- **Core Development**: The V-Sekai development team will handle all core aspects of the game, including coding, art, and design.
- **Community Contributions**: Open to contributions from the Godot XR community for additional content and features.
