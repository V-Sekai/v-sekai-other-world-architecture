# Accepted: Focusing on PCVR vs Android Build vs Web Build

## Context

V-Sekai is a project that aims to bring social VR functionality to the Godot Engine. The current dilemma is whether to focus on an Android/Web build, potentially moving away from PCVR as the primary platform, or continue focusing on PCVR.

## Problem Statement

The team lacks a high-powered enterprise sales team for enterprise PCVR. The mobile Vulkan is considered due to its ability to use compute shaders to skeleton skin meshes for large avatar counts. However, Meta dominates the standalone VR software market, and matching their offerings requires a superior product.

Meta dominates the standalone VR software market but they are limited by the laws of physics.

## Proposal

Given the current market situation and V-Sekai's capabilities, it is suggested to focus on PCVR. This platform can offer high-quality AAA games with lots of content, which standalone games cannot currently provide.

## Benefits

- Ability to offer high-quality AAA games with lots of content.
- Less crowded market compared to the standalone VR software market.
- We can make more experiences.
- We can make better experiences.
- The PCVR hardware is more capable (vulkan, shader functions, less need to optimize), so the same experiences are easier to create.
- PCVR is easier to develop and test.
- PCVR is more open to collaboration.

## Downsides

- Requires a significant investment in PCVR development.
- The market for PCVR is growing but lacks spotlight.

## The Road Not Taken

Focusing on an Android build would mean entering a highly competitive market dominated by established players like Meta. It would also require aggressively pursuing game developers for exclusive content, which could be a challenging strategy.

## Infrequent Use Case

If Meta decides to shift focus towards the consumer AR market, leaving the gaming market, there could be an opportunity for V-Sekai to fill the gap.

## In Core and Done by Us

The decision to focus on PCVR will be a core strategy for V-Sekai, implemented by the development team.
