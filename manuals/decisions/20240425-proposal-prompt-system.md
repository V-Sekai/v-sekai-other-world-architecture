# Proposed: ChatGPT-4 Based Proposal Prompt System

## Context

In the current scenario, creating proposals can be a time-consuming task. It requires a lot of brainstorming and writing which can sometimes lead to inefficiency and delay in work.

## Problem Statement

The problem lies in the manual creation of proposals. The process is slow and often lacks creativity due to human limitations. There is a need for an automated system that can generate proposals efficiently and creatively.

## Proposed Solution

We propose a system that uses OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 to generate proposals. The user will provide a prompt such as `Create a proposal. Don't be purple. Be snappy.` and the system will use this prompt to generate a proposal.

## Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: This system will significantly reduce the time taken to create proposals.
2. **Creativity**: With GPT-4's advanced language model, the proposals generated will be creative and engaging.
3. **Ease of Use**: Users just need to provide a prompt and the system will take care of the rest.

## Downsides

The system may not always provide the best decision but only the most common wisdom. It might require human intervention to fine-tune the proposals.

## The Road Not Taken

There could be other AI models or methods to automate the proposal generation process. However, considering the performance and capabilities of GPT-4, it seems to be the most suitable choice.

## The Infrequent Use Case

This system might not be very useful for users who rarely need to create proposals.

## In Core and Done by Us

The system will be developed and maintained by the V-Sekai development team.
