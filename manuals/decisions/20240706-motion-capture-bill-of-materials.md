## The Benefits

- **High-Quality Streaming:** The setup ensures high-resolution streaming with minimal latency.
- **Accurate Motion Capture:** Multiple trackers provide precise motion capture for various body parts.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** The combination of facial and motion trackers offers a more immersive VR experience.

## The Downsides

- **Cost:** The setup involves high-end components, which can be expensive.
- **Complexity:** Setting up and maintaining the system requires technical expertise.
- **Space Requirements:** Adequate space is needed to use the motion capture system effectively.

## The Road Not Taken

Alternative solutions such as using lower-end VR headsets or fewer motion trackers were considered but not chosen due to their limitations in providing high-quality streaming and accurate motion capture.

## The Infrequent Use Case

Infrequent use cases include scenarios where only basic motion capture is needed, such as simple VR interactions without the need for full-body tracking or high-resolution streaming.

## In Core and Done by Us

The V-Sekai development team will handle the integration and setup of the proposed components into the core system.
