# Proposed: Enhancing V-Sekai x Godot Engine x AYON for a Superior Workflow

## Metadata

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Deciders:** V-Sekai, fire
- **Tags:** `V-Sekai`, `Godot Engine`, `Virtual Reality`

## The Backdrop

The V-Sekai Project is an open-source initiative that aims to bring social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine.

## The Challenge

One of the market leaders in VRSNS, the OMEGA project, is tied to a specific game engine and faces two key challenges in bundling their game engine:

1. The size of the bundle would be quite large.
2. They are separate entities that require commercial terms to bundle together.
3. Components are not commercial-friendly opensource.

We have the opportunity to enhance AYON to create a superior launcher for the Godot Engine and the Project, something many of our competitors cannot do due to similar constraints.

## The Strategy

Our strategy is to outperform OMEGA's workflow by enhancing AYON through tooling and comprehensive documentation. By providing clear instructions and efficient tools for developers, we aim to streamline the development process and improve efficiency.

## The Upside

This approach could potentially lead to a more diverse range of social VR experiences and help grow the Godot Engine community.

## The Downside

Enhancing AYON and creating comprehensive documentation is a time-consuming process and requires ongoing maintenance.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative option would be to develop an individual plugin or extension. However, this requires significant resources and may not be feasible for an open-source project.

## The Infrequent Use Case

While developing a plugin or extension provides out-of-the-box functionality, it may not cover all use cases and could limit the diversity of social VR experiences.

## In Core and Done by Us?

By focusing on enhancing AYON and creating comprehensive documentation, we are empowering developers to implement these features in their own unique ways.
