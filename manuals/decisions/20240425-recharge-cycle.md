# Proposed: Stuck / Recharge Cycle

## The Context

In the realm of software development, it's common for developers to hit a wall or get "stuck" on a particular problem. This can lead to frustration and decreased productivity.

## The Problem Statement

Developers often find themselves stuck on a problem, unable to make progress. This can be due to a variety of reasons such as lack of understanding, complexity of the problem, or simply mental fatigue.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

The proposed solution is a "Stuck/Recharge" cycle. When a developer finds themselves stuck on a problem, they switch to working on someone else's problem. This change in perspective can help recharge their mental energy and when they return to their original problem, they may find that they are able to approach it with a fresh mindset.

```javascript
if (developer.isStuck()) {
    developer.switchTask();
    developer.recharge();
    developer.returnToOriginalTask();
}
```

## The Benefits

This approach can help prevent burnout and increase overall productivity. It also promotes collaboration and knowledge sharing among the team.

## The Downsides

There could be potential downsides such as context switching overhead and disruption of flow. However, these can be mitigated with proper task management and communication within the team.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could be to have dedicated "unsticking" sessions where developers come together to brainstorm solutions for stuck problems. However, this requires coordination and may not be as flexible as the proposed solution.

## The Infrequent Use Case

This proposal may not be beneficial for simple tasks or for developers who rarely get stuck.

## In Core and Done by Us

This proposal is applicable to our core development process and can be implemented by us.
