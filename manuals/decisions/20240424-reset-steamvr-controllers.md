# Accepted: Prioritizing Valve Controllers Over Meta Quest 3 Controllers

## The Context

We are considering the use of Quest 3 and Lighthouse tracked Valve Index controllers for our project when using playspace calibration.

## The Problem Statement

The issue we face is that when a Meta Quest 3 is used, it takes over the controller priority. So we're unable to open the steamvr menu.

## Solution Proposal

To address this problem, we propose turning the SteamVR Index controller on and off. This action will prioritize the Valve controller over the Meta controller.

## The Benefits

- Ensures optimal functionality of the Valve controller.
- Prevents interference from the Meta controller.

## The Downsides

- May need to be adjusted for different hardware configurations.

## The Road Not Taken

We could have chosen to let the Meta controller take priority, but this would not have been ideal for our specific needs.

## The Infrequent Use Case

This solution may not be necessary for users who do not use a Meta Quest 3.
