## Context

The VRM importer and specification in Godot Engine necessitates a T-Pose. However, artists often prefer using an A-Pose as it simplifies body modeling.

## Problem

The issue arises when Blender VRM defaults the skeleton without adjusting the pose.

## Solution

Here's a step-by-step guide to overcome this limitation:

1. Select all bones and create an animation pose for A-Pose. (Optional)
2. Click on the mirror axis butterfly icon and the x-axis.
3. Adjust the shoulder by approximately 15 degrees and position the upper arm to form a T-Pose.
4. Position the legs straight and at shoulder width apart to match the T-Pose.
5. Select all bones again and create an animation pose for T-Pose. (Optional)

## Benefits

This solution allows artists to continue using their preferred A-Pose for modeling while still meeting the T-Pose requirement of the VRM importer in Godot Engine.

## Drawbacks

The process of manually adjusting the pose from A-Pose to T-Pose can be time-consuming and may require some technical knowledge.

## Alternatives Not Pursued

At this time, no other alternatives have been pursued.

## Rare Use Cases

This solution is primarily beneficial for artists who prefer using A-Pose for modeling but need to meet the T-Pose requirement of the VRM importer in Godot Engine.
