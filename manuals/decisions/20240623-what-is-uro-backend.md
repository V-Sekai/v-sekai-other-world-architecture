# Proposed: Why did we build "Uro"?

## The Context

V-Sekai is an open-source project that brings social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine. It has a complex architecture involving multiple components, including a game client, a backend called "Uro", and game servers.

## The Problem Statement

There is a need to explain the architecture of V-Sekai, specifically the roles and interactions of the game client, the Uro backend, and the game servers.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

The game client is the application that users interact with. It connects to both Uro, our backend service, and directly to game servers.

The game editor is a separate tool used by game designers. They use it to create and upload new worlds, props, and avatars to the Uro backend.

Uro is the backend service for our game. It handles requests from both the game client and game editor. It stores and serves game assets like worlds, props, and avatars.

Game servers are responsible for running the game logic in real-time. They communicate with the game clients to keep the game state synchronized between all players.

## The Benefits

Understanding the architecture of V-Sekai can help developers contribute more effectively to the project. It can also help users troubleshoot issues and understand the capabilities and limitations of the system.

## The Downsides

The complexity of the architecture may be daunting for some, and there may be a learning curve involved in understanding it.

## The Road Not Taken

- An alternative approach could have been to implement a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture. In this setup, each game client also acts as a mini-server, communicating directly with other clients.
- Another alternative would be to use cloud-based game backends such as Microsoft's PlayFab. These services can automatically scale up or down based on demand, ensuring that there's always enough capacity for all players.
- Nakama is an open-source distributed social and realtime server for games and apps. It has a rich feature set including user accounts, chat, social, matchmaker, realtime multiplayer, and much more.

## The Infrequent Use Case

The primary use case for the Uro server is to facilitate interactions between the game client and the game servers, there may be infrequent use cases where its functionality could be extended or used in different ways. For example, it is can be used to implement additional features such as leaderboards, achievements, or social networking features within the game. These use cases, while not common, should still be considered when designing and implementing the Uro server.

## In Core and Done by Us

This proposal is core to the V-Sekai project and will be implemented by the V-Sekai development team.
