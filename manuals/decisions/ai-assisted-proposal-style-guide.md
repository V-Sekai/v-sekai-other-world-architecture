# Accepted: AI Assisted Style Guide

## The Context

In the realm of proposal writing, maintaining a consistent and professional style is crucial. However, when utilizing AI to assist in this process, the output often lacks the desired stylistic quality.

## The Problem Statement

When we instruct AI to help complete our proposals, we often encounter issues with poor style and inconsistent formatting.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. **Avoid Purple Speech**: Ensure that the language used is clear and concise, avoiding overly elaborate or flowery expressions.
2. **Be Snappy**: Keep sentences short and to the point to maintain reader engagement.
3. **Avoid Redundant Phrases**: Refrain from using redundant phrases like "effective altruism" since true altruism inherently implies effectiveness.
4. **Maintain Consistent Headers**: Adhere to the header structure provided in the template to ensure uniformity across documents.

## The Benefits

- **Improved Readability**: Clear and concise language enhances the readability of proposals.
- **Consistency**: Maintaining a consistent style ensures that all documents have a professional appearance.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined guidelines make it easier for AI to generate high-quality content quickly.

## The Downsides

- **Limited Creativity**: Strict adherence to style guidelines may limit creative expression.
- **Initial Setup Time**: Establishing and fine-tuning the style guide may require an initial investment of time and resources.

## The Road Not Taken

Alternative approaches such as manual editing or using different AI models were considered but ultimately deemed less efficient or effective.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In scenarios where highly specialized or technical language is required, additional human oversight may be necessary to ensure accuracy and appropriateness.
