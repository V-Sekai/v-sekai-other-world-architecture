# Proposed: Defining the List of Godot Types in Elixir Godot Parsers

## Metadata

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Deciders**: V-Sekai Development Team
- **Tags**: Godot Engine, Elixir, Type Definitions, V-Sekai

## The Backdrop

The `elixir_godot_parsers` project under V-Sekai aims to enhance the integration and parsing capabilities between the Elixir programming language and the Godot Engine. A key component of this is understanding and effectively parsing various data types used in Godot.

## The Challenge

Currently, there may be ambiguities or a lack of clear definition for all Godot types within the `elixir_godot_parsers` project. This can lead to inconsistencies in parsing and handling data, potentially affecting the efficiency and reliability of the integration.

## The Strategy

Propose the creation of a comprehensive, well-documented list of all Godot types. This list should be detailed and include specifications for each type, ensuring clarity and consistency in how Elixir handles and parses these types.

## The Upside

Defining a clear list of Godot types will enhance the reliability and functionality of the Elixir-Godot integration. This will make the development process smoother, reduce bugs, and improve the overall efficiency of projects using both Elixir and Godot.

## The Downside

Compiling and maintaining this list could be time-consuming. It may also require regular updates to stay in sync with any changes or updates in the Godot Engine.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could be to continue without a defined list, relying on ad-hoc solutions for each type as needed. However, this could lead to increased development time and potential errors.

## The Infrequent Use Case

While this proposal primarily targets the Elixir-Godot integration, having a well-defined list of types could also be beneficial for other projects or integrations involving the Godot Engine.

## In Core and Done by Us?

This task involves direct contributions to the core functionality of the `elixir_godot_parsers` project under V-Sekai, aiming to enhance its core capabilities in terms of data handling and parsing.
