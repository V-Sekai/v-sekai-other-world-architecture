## The Backdrop

Virtual Reality (VR) is a rapidly evolving field, with new technologies and techniques being developed constantly. One of the key areas of focus in VR development is creating realistic and expressive avatars. This is where Mesh Transformers comes into play.

## The Challenge

The challenge lies in enhancing non-verbal communication in virtual reality by generating diverse facial structures and features that are expressive yet efficient in terms of polygon count. This includes creating a variety of facial shapes, eye configurations, nose shapes, and mouth designs.

## The Strategy

The strategy is to employ Mesh Transformers to generate these facial features. The aim is to offer a range of facial features that can later be animated or rigged for various expressions, greatly enriching the social and emotional dynamics of VR experiences.

## The Upside

The upside is the creation of more immersive and engaging virtual environments, with avatars that can express a wide range of emotions and reactions.

## The Downside

The downside could be the potential increase in complexity and computational requirements due to the addition of more detailed and expressive facial features.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could have been to use simpler, less expressive avatar designs. However, this would limit the range of non-verbal communication possible in VR environments.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In cases where VR environments are used for simple tasks or interactions, the need for highly expressive avatars may not be as high.

## In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, this proposal is core to our mission of enhancing VR experiences and will be implemented by our team.
