# Proposed: Advanced VR Armature System for V-Sekai

## Metadata

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Deciders:** V-Sekai Core Team
- **Tags:** Virtual Reality, Rigging, Animation, IK Systems, Development

## Introduction

The V-Sekai community needs better rigging and animation tools specifically tailored for VR. The goal is to move beyond the current limitations of traditional approaches.

## Objective

Develop an intuitive inverse kinematics (IK) system for VR avatars that removes the need for numerical input, enhancing the user experience.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed VR Armature System includes:

- Handles designed for VR interaction.
- Visual indicators for joint movement ranges.
- Straightforward adjustment methods without requiring numbers.

## Technical Implementation Steps

1. **Handle Control Design:**

   - Craft VR-appropriate ergonomic handles.
   - Track VR controller for handle interaction.

2. **Visual Indicator Development:**

   - Visualize joint limits.
   - Update indicators with joint movement.

3. **IK Solver Integration:**

   - Employ IK solver for joint positioning.
   - Validate across different avatar models.

4. **Interface & Interaction:**

   - Interface design for easy joint manipulation.
   - Implement feedback for joint limit reach.

5. **Testing & Debugging:**

   - User testing for intuitive use.
   - Refine system via user feedback.

6. **System Finalization:**

   - Establish final iteration post-testing.
   - Optimize for VR performance.

7. **Documentation & Training:**
   - Produce user guides and tutorials.
   - Conduct capability and usage training sessions.

## Benefits

Implementing this system aims to improve the creation process in VR and establish V-Sekai as a cutting-edge developer of VR tools.

## Considerations

The introduction of a new system may require substantial resources and time for users to become familiar with it.

## Alternatives Evaluated

Other options, like enhancing existing numerical controls or looking into traditional motion capture technologies, were considered but didn't meet our immersive needs.

## Extended Applications

While focused on VR, this system could also benefit animators using more conventional methods by providing improved interfaces and easier rig manipulation.

## Alignment with V-Sekai

It's crucial for V-Sekai to maintain this project to ensure it meets our quality standards and integrates seamlessly with our core technologies.
