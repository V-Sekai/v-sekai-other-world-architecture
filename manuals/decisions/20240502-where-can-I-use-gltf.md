# Proposed: Can I use V-Sekai for 3d assets & 3d extensions?

## The Context

In the current digital landscape, there is a chaos of many different platforms.

## The Problem Statement

The problem lies in the lack of interoperability among various platforms. This leads to inefficiencies and difficulties in sharing and utilizing resources across these platforms, especially when it comes to 3D assets and extensions.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

We propose to develop an Elixir website that facilitates the sharing of interoperability among different file formats including fbx, usd, gltf, Godot Engine tscn, and vrm. This would allow for easier sharing and utilization of 3D assets and extensions across various platforms.

## The Benefits

This proposal, if implemented, would streamline the process of sharing and using 3D resources across different platforms. It would also foster collaboration and innovation by making it easier for developers to utilize resources from various sources.

## The Downsides

Potential downsides could include the complexity of developing such a platform and ensuring its compatibility with all the mentioned file formats. There may also be potential security concerns that need to be addressed.

## The Road Not Taken

Alternative solutions could involve developing individual converters for each file format, but this would not provide the same level of efficiency and convenience as a unified platform.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In cases where only one or two file formats are being used, the benefits of this platform may not be fully realized.

## In Core and Done by Us

This project would be developed and maintained by the V-Sekai development team.
