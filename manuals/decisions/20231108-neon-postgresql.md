# Proposed: Adopting Neon for a More Manageable Backend at V-Sekai

## Metadata

- Status: Proposed
- Deciders: V-Sekai, Fire
- Tags: Backend Management, Neon, Ease-of-Use, Postgres

## The Backdrop

V-Sekai's current setup with Postgres and Uro is hitting roadblocks due to the lack of dedicated server management expertise.

## The Challenge

Is Neon the key to a more manageable Postgres system that fits our community-driven model?

## The Strategy

We plan to run a Neon pilot to see if it eases our backend management woes. Steps include:

- Testing Neon's compatibility with our current data.
- Exploring Neon's manageability features.
- Drafting straightforward documentation for team reference.
- Ensuring a hassle-free data migration process.

## The Upside

- A more user-friendly backend system.
- Reduced need for server management know-how.
- Potential performance benefits are a bonus.

## The Downside

- Time investment in learning a new system.
- Possible initial dependence on external support.

## The Road Not Taken

Sticking with Uro or other complex solutions that donâ€™t align with our manageability goals.

## The Infrequent Use Case

Situations where Uro's specific configurations are essential; these will require special attention.

## In Core and Done by Us?

Planning to make Neon a central part of our backend, relying on our collective skills to implement it.
