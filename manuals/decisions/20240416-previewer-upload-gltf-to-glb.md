# Proposed: Implementing a 3D Previewer for GLTF with XMP Metadata

## Context

The current project involves the use of 3D models in GLTF format. These models also contain XMP metadata which needs to be previewed.

## Problem Statement

The challenge lies in creating a 3D previewer that handles GLTF files and their associated XMP metadata. The aim is to have one file per entry, making it easier to manage and organize the data.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution involves loading a GLTF file and saving it as a GLB file. This process is lossless, meaning no data will be lost during the conversion. The GLB file will then preview the 3D model and its metadata.

```pseudo
function convertToGLB(gltfFile) {
    // Load the GLTF file
    var gltf = loadGLTF(gltfFile);

    // Convert the GLTF to GLB
    var glb = gltf.toGLB();

    // Save the GLB file
    saveGLB(glb);
}
```

## Benefits

- Simplifies the workflow by having only one file per entry.
- No loss of data during the conversion from GLTF to GLB.
- Makes it easier to compress in Godot Engine's workflow.

## Downsides

- Requires additional processing to convert GLTF files to GLB.
- Might increase the overall size of the project due to the conversion.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could be to keep the GLTF and XMP metadata separate and create a previewer that can handle multiple files. However, this would complicate the workflow and make it harder to manage the data.

## The Infrequent Use Case

This proposal might not be beneficial for projects that do not require a 3D previewer or do not use GLTF files.
