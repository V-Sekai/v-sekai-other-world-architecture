# Proposed: Dataset Creation with CSG

## The Context

We're working on a project that involves creating 3D models using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG). We need to create a dataset of these models, but we can't afford to pay for it and we don't want to build our own platform.

## The Problem Statement

The challenge is how to gather a large and diverse set of 3D models represented as CSG trees without financial expenditure and without building our own platform.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. **Engage Open-Source Communities**: Connect with people who are into 3D modeling and CSG. They might be interested in contributing to our project.

2. **Collaborate with Educational Institutions**: Partner with colleges that offer courses in 3D modeling. Students could contribute to our project as part of their coursework or for extra credit.

3. **Provide Clear Guidelines**: Write up detailed instructions on how to create and submit the models. This should include technical specifications, style guides, and examples.

4. **Implement a Review Process**: Each model should be reviewed to ensure it meets our quality standards and follows our style guide.

5. **Use Existing Platforms for Submission**: Use platforms like GitHub or Google Drive for contributors to submit their models.

## The Benefits

- We can gather a large and diverse dataset without having to pay.
- Checking the models ourselves ensures they'll be of good quality and consistent.
- Using an existing platform saves us time and resources.

## The Downsides

- Managing a project with volunteers can be complex and time-consuming.
- Ensuring consistent quality and style across all submissions may be challenging.
- Depending on external platforms for submission might limit some functionalities that could be possible with a custom-built platform.

## The Road Not Taken

We could consider using existing open-source 3D model datasets, but these might not meet our specific needs in terms of quality, style, and representation as CSG trees.

## The Infrequent Use Case

This approach might not be suitable if we need very specific models in our dataset that require specialized knowledge or skills to create.

## In Core and Done by Us

The management of the project, the provision of clear guidelines, and the review of the submissions will be done by us, using our resources and expertise.
