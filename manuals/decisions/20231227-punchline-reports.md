# Proposed: Use the "Punchline Reports" Method

## Metadata

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Deciders:** V-Sekai, fire
- **Tags:** V-Sekai

## Context

The article "I'm OK; The Bull Is Dead" from Computerworld discusses a method for reporting project status effectively. This method prioritizes delivering the most important information first, followed by supporting details.

## Problem

Traditional reporting styles often start with lengthy explanations which can delay the delivery of crucial information.

## Solution

Implement a four-step approach to reporting:

1. **Start with the punch line** – the facts without adjectives or modifiers.
2. **Describe the current status** and how it affects the project.
3. **Outline the next steps or solutions**.
4. **Provide an explanation or reason** behind the punch line.

This approach is likened to the inverted pyramid style in journalism, where conclusions are presented first, followed by key facts, and then details.

## Benefits

- Faster delivery of crucial information.
- Clearer understanding of the project status.
- More effective communication within the team.

## Potential Drawbacks

- May require training or adjustment period for team members used to traditional reporting styles.

## Alternatives Considered

Continuing with traditional reporting styles.

## Rare Use Cases

This method may not be suitable for projects where the context or background information is as important as the main facts.

## Implementation

Should we decide to proceed, we will need to train our team on this new reporting method and adjust our project management tools accordingly.
