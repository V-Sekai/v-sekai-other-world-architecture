# Proposed: Teaching Large Language Models (LLMs) with Goal-Task Planners

## Context

We're looking at using LLMs and goal-task planners like pyhop to generate innovative, executable plans. This approach combines the creativity of LLMs with the structured planning processes of goal-task planners.

## Problem Statement

The main challenges are computational overhead due to the two-step process and potential inaccuracies in the feasibility check.

## Proposed Solution

We propose using an LLM for idea generation and a goal-task planner for checking feasibility. This could lead to creative and feasible plans. The accurate plans generated by this model can then be used to further train the LLM.

```python
# Pseudo-code
gpt = GPT()
idea = gpt.generate_idea()

pyhop = Pyhop()
feasible = pyhop.find_plan(state, goal_generator())

if feasible:
    gpt.train(idea)
```

## Benefits

1. **Innovation**: Using LLMs for idea generation can lead to creative ideas.
2. **Practicality**: Passing the generated ideas through a goal-task planner ensures that the plans are innovative but also feasible and executable.
3. **Continuous Learning**: The LLM can learn from the accurate plans, improving its performance over time.

## Downsides

1. **Computational Overhead**: There might be a computational overhead due to the two-step process.
2. **Accuracy of Feasibility Check**: The feasibility check might not always be accurate.

## Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could be to run the LLM and the goal-task planner in parallel to address the computational overhead.

## Infrequent Use Case

This method may not be suitable for tasks that require immediate results due to the time taken by the two-step process.
