# Proposed: V-Sekai Setup as a Ready-to-Go Kit

## The Context

V-Sekai is an open-source project that focuses on bringing social VR functionality to the Godot Engine. It aims to create a metaverse where users can interact and engage in various activities.

## The Problem Statement

The current setup process for V-Sekai is complex and time-consuming, which may deter potential users and developers. We need to simplify this process by creating a ready-to-go kit.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

The ready-to-go kit will be a pre-configured package containing all necessary files and dependencies for running V-Sekai. Users will simply need to download and extract the package to get started.

1. Download V-Sekai Kit
2. Extract Files
3. Run V-Sekai

## The Benefits

- Simplified setup process
- Increased accessibility for non-technical users
- Potential increase in user base and community contributions

## The Downsides

- Maintenance of the kit could become resource-intensive if not automated
- Potential security risks if not properly managed

## The Road Not Taken

We could have continued with the existing setup process, but this would likely limit the growth and accessibility of V-Sekai.

## The Infrequent Use Case

Users who wish to customize their V-Sekai experience extensively may find the ready-to-go kit limiting. However, they still have the option to manually set up V-Sekai.

## In Core and Done by Us

This proposal will be implemented by the V-Sekai development team.
