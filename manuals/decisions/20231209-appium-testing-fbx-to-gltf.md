# Proposed: Appium Testing for Windows 11

## Metadata

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Deciders**: V-Sekai
- **Tags**: V-Sekai

## The Backdrop

In the realm of game development, providing a seamless user experience across various platforms is crucial. This necessitates the implementation of effective testing methodologies.

## The Challenge

The primary challenge we face is the establishment of a robust testing framework that ensures cross-platform compatibility. Our focus is particularly on ensuring compatibility with the VR compatible desktop mode on Windows 11.

## The Strategy

To address this problem, we propose the automation of the testing process using Appium. A significant part of this strategy involves the conversion of FBX files, which are commonly used formats for 3D models and animations, into GLB format.

## The Upside

This strategy promises to ensure a high-quality gaming experience.

## The Downside

It may require substantial resources and could potentially present unforeseen challenges.

## The Road Not Taken

We have considered other testing frameworks, but our proposed strategy with Appium offers the best balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

## The Infrequent Use Case

Our strategy might not cover infrequent or edge cases in game development. However, these will be identified and addressed as they arise.

## In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, this strategy is core to our project and will be implemented by our team.
