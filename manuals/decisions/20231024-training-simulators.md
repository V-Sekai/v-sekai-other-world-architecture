# Proposed: Implementing Advanced Training Simulators in V-Sekai

## Metadata

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Deciders:** V-Sekai
- **Tags:** V-Sekai, Game Development, Skill Simulation

## The Backdrop

In the world of V-Sekai, players can level up their skills and unlock advanced training simulators. These simulators provide access to comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and allow players to practice actions in a safe environment.

## The Challenge

The challenge lies in creating an immersive and realistic simulation experience that doesn't harm the player's character. For instance, if a player is an engineer, they should be able to practice replacing a plasma conduit, learn how to use the tools, and understand how to safely isolate sections for repairs.

## The Strategy

To overcome this challenge, we propose developing a robust system that allows players to interact with the game environment in a meaningful way. This includes creating detailed SOPs, designing intuitive user interfaces for tool manipulation, and implementing safety measures within the game.

## The Upside

By providing a realistic and immersive simulation experience, we can enhance player engagement and satisfaction. Players will have the opportunity to learn and practice new skills, which can add depth to the gameplay.

## The Downside

The main downside is the complexity and resources required to implement such a system. It may also be challenging to balance realism with fun gameplay.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could be to simplify the skill system and focus more on traditional gameplay elements. However, this would not provide the same level of immersion and learning opportunities for the players.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In some cases, players may prefer a more straightforward gameplay experience and may not fully utilize the advanced training simulators.

## In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, this feature is core to the V-Sekai experience and will be developed by our team.
