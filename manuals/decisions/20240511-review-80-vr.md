# Rejected: VR Game with 80 Players and One World Server

## The Context

We aim to create a virtual reality (VR) game that can support eighty players simultaneously using a single world server.

## The Problem Statement

The challenge lies in managing the load of player simulations, world server, and game state delivery.

We update the state of PLAYER_COUNT vsync times on a TBD CPU bare metal machine.

It takes 30ms to update the database on the prototype on `VSK_godot/modules/mvsqlite/demo` returning the list of all changed states.

We are going with the grid approach. Our world is a 1km by 1km area and each grid cell is 100m squared.

A 1x1 grid of 100m squared requires 1 server.

Our database is SQLite FoundationDB.

The game state delivery process involves the world server generating a stream of data containing the states of all players. This data is then sent to the client-side for rendering and interaction.

This list can then be used to generate the TBD gigabit/sec stream of packets that is sent from the world server.

Please note that the limiting factor here is due to the lack of multicast support over the internet.

## The Benefits

- Supports a moderate number of players simultaneously
- Provides a rich, immersive gaming experience
- Simplified infrastructure with only one world server

## The Downsides

- Requires significant resources and infrastructure
- Bandwidth requirements may be high for some players
- Lack of multicast support over the internet could limit game state delivery

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative would be to increase the number of players or world servers, but this would require more resources and infrastructure.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In cases where player traffic is consistently low, the infrastructure may be underutilized.

## In Core and Done by Us

The proposed stress testing will be conducted by the V-Sekai development team.
