# Proposed: V-Sekai Implementation Using SLC Framework

## Context

VR gaming requires a seamless, inviting experience. A VR dating game can utilize simplicity, engagement, and completeness principles.

## Problem

The challenge is creating an intuitive, engaging VR dating game with a comprehensive feature set from the start.

## Proposal

Using the SLC framework—Simple, Lovable, Complete—the project should:

- **Simple:** Emphasize user-friendly design and easy navigation.

  ```pseudo
  function interact_with_object(object):
      if object.is_interactable:
          show_prompt("Press X to interact")
          wait_for_input()
          execute_interaction()
  ```

- **Lovable:** Develop appealing characters and environments.

  Character customization concept art

- **Complete:** Launch with diverse scenarios and detailed character interactions.

  ```yaml
  launch_features:
    - CompleteCharacterCustomization
    - DiverseScenarios
    - InDepthCharacterInteractions
    - RealTimeChat
  ```

## Benefits

This approach ensures an accessible, captivating product without immediate expansion need, catering to a wide audience.

## Downsides

An extensive initial development phase may delay release, and simplicity could limit advanced functionalities.

## Alternate Approach

A leaner initial version might allow earlier release but risk losing early adopters.

## Infrequent Users Consideration

Design a user-friendly re-engagement process for returning users.

## Development Philosophy

Focus on essential launch features, expand based on user feedback.
