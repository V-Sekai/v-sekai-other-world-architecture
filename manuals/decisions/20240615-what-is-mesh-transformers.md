# Proposed: Explain the concept of Mesh Transformers

## The Context

Many of my friends are not tech-savvy.

## The Problem Statement

How can we explain the concept of Mesh Transformers to a student?

## Solution Proposal

Mesh Transformers can be understood as two parts - a construction worker (auto encoder) and an architect (transformer).

The construction worker learns how to construct and build a building, while the architect learns about all the items needed for a building and then instructs the construction worker on what to do.

The goal is to allow users to generate a 3D model on the fly using a prompt, instead of searching through numerous 3D libraries and forums. They can simply write what they want and within a few seconds get exactly what they want without settling on a 3D model that they kind of want.

## The Benefits

This approach simplifies the process of creating 3D models, making it accessible even to those with little to no technical knowledge. It also saves time by eliminating the need to search through various resources.

## The Downsides

There might be a learning curve involved in understanding how to use prompts effectively. Also, the quality of the generated 3D model may vary based on the specificity of the prompt.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative could have been to create a user-friendly interface for browsing and selecting from pre-existing 3D models. However, this would not offer the same level of customization and convenience as generating a model from a prompt.

## The Infrequent Use Case

Users who require highly detailed and specific 3D models may find the prompt-based generation less useful, as it may not always produce the desired level of detail or accuracy.

## In Core and Done by Us

This proposal involves developing a new feature for our platform, which will be done by our development team.
