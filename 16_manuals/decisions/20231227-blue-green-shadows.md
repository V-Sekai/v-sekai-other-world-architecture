# Proposed: Blue Green new shadows for new avatars

## Metadata

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Deciders**: V-Sekai
- **Tags**: V-Sekai

## The Backdrop

The default avatar format in V-Sekai, vrm0, has a shadow color that is too pink (F7CFDB). This has been a point of contention among users and developers alike.

## The Challenge

The challenge lies in changing the default shadow color for new models to something more universally appealing. Two colors have been suggested as alternatives:

| Color Description | ASCII Hex Code |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Sage Green        | #8F9779        |
| Soft Sky Blue     | #B4C8E5        |

## The Strategy

The strategy would involve modifying the default settings in the vrm0 avatar format for new models to use one of the proposed colors instead of the current pink shade.

## The Upside

Changing the default shadow color for new models could lead to a more visually pleasing user experience. It could also potentially increase user satisfaction and engagement.

## The Downside

Some users may prefer the current pink shadow color. Changing it for new models could lead to dissatisfaction among this group of users.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could be to allow users to customize the shadow color themselves. However, this could potentially complicate the user interface and make the platform more difficult to use for beginners.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In some cases, the pink shadow color might actually be preferred. For example, in certain lighting conditions or for certain types of avatars, the pink color might look better than the proposed alternatives.

## In Core and Done by Us?

This change would need to be implemented by the V-Sekai development team. It would likely require modifications to the core code of the platform.
