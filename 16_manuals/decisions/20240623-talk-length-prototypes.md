# Proposed: Talk Length Game Prototypes

## The Context

V-Sekai is a Virtual Reality Social Network Service (VRSNS).

## The Problem Statement

What length should a game demo be?

## Proposal

One suggestion is to make the game demo the length of a TED talk. A TED Talk is typically 18 minutes long. This duration is considered optimal for maintaining audience attention and conveying a powerful message, which is exactly what we aim to achieve with our game demo.

## The Benefits

- **Attention Span**: An 18-minute demo aligns well with the average person's attention span. It's long enough to immerse the player in the game world and showcase its features, but not so long that it risks losing the player's interest.
- **Depth of Experience**: This length allows us to provide a substantial preview of the game without overwhelming the player. We can introduce the main gameplay mechanics, narrative elements, and unique features within this timeframe.
- **Unique Selling Point**: Having a TED talk-length game demo could serve as a unique selling point, distinguishing V-Sekai from other VRSNS.

## The Downsides

- **Not One-Size-Fits-All**: The length of a TED talk may not be suitable for all types of games. Some games might require longer playtimes to fully appreciate their depth and complexity.
- **Player Preferences**: Some players might prefer shorter or longer demos. We would need to ensure that our target audience is comfortable with this length.

## The Road Not Taken

Alternative lengths for the game demo could be considered, such as the length of a typical movie or TV episode.

## The Infrequent Use Case

This proposal may not apply to games that are designed to be played in short bursts.

## In Core and Done by Us

This proposal would be implemented by the V-Sekai development team.
