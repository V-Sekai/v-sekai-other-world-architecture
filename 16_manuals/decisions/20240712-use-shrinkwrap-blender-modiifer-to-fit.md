# Proposed: Use shrink wrap blender modifier to fit

## The Context

Want to make an avatar clothing for VRChat.

## The Problem Statement

Our cloth shirt is too baggy, we want to fit to the person.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Use modifier shrinkswap in Blender 3d modeling tool.
2. Nearest surface points
3. Above surface
4. Target the body of the character
5. Offset 2 mm.

## The Benefits

- **Improved Fit**: Ensures that the clothing fits snugly to the avatar's body.
- **Enhanced Appearance**: Provides a more realistic and appealing look for the avatar.
- **Customization**: Allows for easy adjustments to fit different body types.

## The Downsides

- **Complexity**: Requires familiarity with Blender and its modifiers.
- **Time-Consuming**: Initial setup and fine-tuning may take time.

## The Road Not Taken

Alternative methods such as manual adjustment or using other software tools were considered but found to be less efficient or effective.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In scenarios where highly detailed or custom-fitted clothing is required, additional manual adjustments may be necessary to achieve the desired result.
