# Proposed: Web-Based Exploration of V-Sekai

## Context

Recently, a discussion arose regarding the potential for creating a web version of V-Sekai. The concept involves utilizing WebAssembly (wasm) for this endeavor. Additionally, there is interest in integrating WebRTC with both native and web platforms.

## Problem Statement

The current iteration of V-Sekai lacks web accessibility, limiting its reach and usability. Furthermore, challenges exist concerning shared array buffer accessibility on Safari and access to ad networks, both of which are vital for online games.

## Proposal

We propose to construct a web version of V-Sekai using wasm. This process will necessitate overcoming the shared array buffer accessibility issue on Safari and ensuring access to ad networks.

## Benefits

- Enhanced accessibility and reach for V-Sekai.
- Improved user experience by allowing access from any device equipped with a web browser.
- Potential revenue increase through ad networks.

## Downsides

- Potential performance issues due to operation on a web platform.
- Possible compatibility issues across different browsers.

## Alternative Path

An alternative approach would be maintaining an exclusive focus on the native platform. However, this would restrict V-Sekai's reach and potential for growth.

## Infrequent Use Case

This proposal will significantly benefit users who prefer or only have access to the web platform.

## Core Implementation by Us

The V-Sekai development team will undertake this project.
