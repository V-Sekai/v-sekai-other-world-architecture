# Accepted: Building a Metaverse with Glue Mechanic in V-Sekai

## The Context

V-Sekai is an open-source project that brings social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine. The current focus of the project is on avatar movement and interaction within a confined space.

## The Problem Statement

The current model of V-Sekai, while functional, seems limited in its scope. It primarily focuses on avatars moving in a room, which restricts the potential for expansive world-building and exploration.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

The proposed solution is to introduce a "glue mechanic" into the system. This mechanic would allow users to build their own vehicles and structures by gluing different elements together. This could potentially open up the possibility for creating entire universes within the metaverse.

This idea was inspired by a game called "Crazy Contraptions" developed by Mantafloof during the Ludum Dare 55 game jam. The game was created in just 48 hours and successfully implemented the glue mechanic concept.

Users can combine different elements (represented here as 'blocks' and 'wheels') to create new structures or vehicles.

## The Benefits

- Encourages creativity and innovation among users.
- Opens up possibilities for expansive world-building and exploration.
- Provides a reason to work on LODs and memory management for loading worlds.

## The Downsides

- May require significant changes to the existing codebase.
- This could potentially increase the complexity of the system.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could be to continue focusing on avatar movement and interaction within a confined space. However, this may limit the potential for expansive world-building and exploration.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In cases where users prefer a more confined and controlled environment, the glue mechanic may not be as appealing. However, it could still provide an interesting option for those looking to experiment with world-building.

## In Core and Done by Us

The implementation of the glue mechanic would be done by the V-Sekai development team.
