## Metadata

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Deciders**: V-Sekai
- **Tags**: V-Sekai

## The Backdrop

The aim is to present a demo at the Game Developer Conference 2024 that will showcase the capabilities of the Godot Engine animation and Godot Engine 3D pipelines.

## The Challenge

The task at hand is to create a Godot Engine demo within a span of one week.

## The Strategy

The proposed idea is "Urban Navigator: The City Unveiled". Embark on an exploratory journey through the heart of a city. Unravel the secrets of a sprawling metropolis where every street corner has a story to tell. With the help of advanced motion matching technology, your gamepad inputs are transformed into lifelike movements, enabling seamless interaction with the city.

## The Upside

The project will demonstrate the power and flexibility of the Godot Engine, potentially attracting more developers to use it. It also provides an opportunity to innovate in the field of urban exploration games.

## The Downside

The tight timeline could lead to compromises in quality or scope. There's also a risk that the final product may not fully meet the expectations set by the proposal.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could have been to focus on a different genre or type of game that might be less complex but still showcases the capabilities of the Godot Engine.

## The Infrequent Use Case

While the primary use case is for the Game Developer Conference demo, the developed game could also be used as a benchmarking tool for testing hardware performance with the Godot Engine.

## In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, this project is core to our mission of showcasing the capabilities of the Godot Engine and can be done by our team.
