# Proposed: Comprehensive Documentation for V-Sekai

## Context

V-Sekai is a project that brings social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine. It has numerous features and topics that need comprehensive documentation for both developers and users.

## Problem Statement

The current documentation lacks detailed information about significant features and topics, making it difficult for users and developers to understand and utilize V-Sekai's full potential.

## Proposed Solution

We propose creating dedicated pages for each feature with descriptive titles and bullet lists of essential points. For instance:

### Topic: Godot XR

- Explanation of XR and Godot
- How XR works in Godot and how V-Sekai utilizes it
- Achievements possible with this feature/knowledge
- Limitations of the technology affecting our product

For step-by-step instructions, we will use straightforward language and consistent verbs and phrasing. For example:

### Changing Game Resolution

1. Open the Project -> Project Settings... menu.
2. Navigate to Display -> Window in the left column.
3. Scroll down to the resolution setting.
4. Click the numbers to change the resolution (values are in pixels).

## Benefits

This proposal will make it easier for users and developers to understand and use V-Sekai. It will also provide a foundation for further development and improvements.

## Downsides

Creating comprehensive documentation requires time and resources. However, the benefits outweigh the costs.

## The Road Not Taken

Without comprehensive documentation, users and developers may struggle to understand and use V-Sekai effectively.

## The Infrequent Use Case

Even infrequent or advanced features should be documented to ensure all users can fully utilize V-Sekai.

## In Core and Done by Us

This proposal will be implemented by the V-Sekai development team and community stakeholders.
