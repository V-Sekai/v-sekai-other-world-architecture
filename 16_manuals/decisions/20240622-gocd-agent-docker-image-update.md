# Accepted: GoCD Agent Docker Image Update

## The Context

We are currently using a GoCD Agent Docker image for our V-Sekai development environment. This Docker image contains all the necessary tools and libraries required for building our projects.

## The Problem Statement

The GoCD Agent Docker image we are using is not up-to-date, which could potentially lead to compatibility issues, security vulnerabilities, and missed improvements from newer versions of the tools and libraries.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

We propose to update all components within the GoCD Agent Docker image. This includes the base OS, installed libraries, and any other software included in the image.

## The Benefits

Updating the GoCD Agent Docker image ensures that we are using the most recent and secure versions of our tools and libraries. It also allows us to take advantage of any new features or performance improvements that have been introduced.

## The Downsides

There may be breaking changes in the newer versions of the tools and libraries, which could require modifications to our existing codebase.

## The Road Not Taken

We could choose not to update the GoCD Agent Docker image, but this could leave us vulnerable to known security issues and prevent us from utilizing improvements in the tools and libraries.

## The Infrequent Use Case

This proposal does not directly address infrequent use cases, as it is focused on maintaining an up-to-date development environment.

## In Core and Done by Us

The updating process will be handled by the V-Sekai development team.
