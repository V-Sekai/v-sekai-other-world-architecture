# Proposed: Art Direction in V-Sekai Process

## The Context

We visited a VRChat world for "Zenless Zone Zero" and discussed how cool the urban maze was created. Lyuma mentioned that he prefers wild open places. We also noted how Mihoyo has three distinct settings:

- **Medieval** (Genshin Impact)
- **Urban Asia** (Zenless Zone Zero)
- **Interstellar** (Star Rail)

## The Problem Statement

We need an art direction in V-Sekai for our work. Without a defined art direction, we risk inconsistency and lack of cohesion in our visual presentation.

## Describe How Your Proposal Will Work with Code, Pseudo-code, Mock-ups, or Diagrams

1. **Concept Art Creation**: Develop initial concept art to explore different themes and styles.
2. **Community Feedback**: Share concept art with the community for feedback and suggestions.
3. **Style Guide Development**: Create a comprehensive style guide based on the chosen art direction.
4. **Implementation**: Apply the style guide across all assets and environments within V-Sekai.

## The Benefits

- **Visual Cohesion**: A unified art direction ensures a consistent and professional appearance.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: A well-defined aesthetic can make the virtual environment more immersive and enjoyable.
- **Brand Identity**: Establishing a unique visual style helps in building a recognizable brand.

## The Downsides

- **Limited Creativity**: Strict adherence to a specific art direction may limit creative expression.
- **Initial Setup Time**: Developing and implementing an art direction requires an initial investment of time and resources.

## The Road Not Taken

Alternative approaches such as allowing individual artists complete freedom or using multiple art styles were considered but ultimately deemed less effective for maintaining visual consistency.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In scenarios where highly specialized or technical visual elements are required, additional oversight may be necessary to ensure they align with the overall art direction.

## In Core and Done by Us

This proposal aligns with our core values of efficiency and professionalism and will be implemented by our team.
