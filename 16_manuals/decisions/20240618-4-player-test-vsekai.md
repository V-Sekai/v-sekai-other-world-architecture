# Proposed: 4 Player Test V-Sekai

## Context

V-Sekai is a social VR functionality for the Godot Engine. It's an open-source project that brings social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine.

## Problem Statement

We want to host a 4 player test tonight.

## Solution

Here is a step-by-step guide on how we can achieve this:

1. **Import a map into V-Sekai**: We will use a map with a CC-BY or CC0 license for the world upload.
2. **Start a server**: We will set up and start a server where the test will be hosted.
3. **Invite people**: We will then invite the players to join the test.

## Benefits

Hosting a 4 player test will allow us to:

- Understand the performance of our application with multiple users.
- Identify any bugs or issues that may arise in a multi-player environment.

## Downsides

Potential downsides could include:

- Server issues due to multiple connections.
- Unidentified bugs causing disruptions during the test.

## The Road Not Taken

Alternative solutions could have been to conduct individual tests with each player, but this would not give us insights into the multi-player experience.

## The Infrequent Use Case

This proposal does not cover scenarios where more than 4 players are needed for testing.

## In Core and Done by Us

The entire process from importing the map to inviting the players will be done by the V-Sekai development team.
