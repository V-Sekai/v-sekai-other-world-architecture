## Metadata

- **Status**: Proposed

- **Tags**: `V-Sekai`

## The Backdrop

A new game concept where players manage a college for magical girls has been proposed. Inspired by "Shadows of Doubt," the game will focus on time management, relationship building, and academic success in a magical setting.

### Inspiration Source

[Shadows of Doubt on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/986130/Shadows_of_Doubt/)

A sandbox stealth game set in an alternate 1980s universe, blending detective work with gathering intelligence and solving cases.

## The Challenge

Develop engaging planner scenarios for the player to navigate over the course of a week.

## The Strategy

Utilize VRM 3D chibis for character representation; initially limiting characters to five core members:

1. The Protagonist
2. Four love interests

### Character Interaction Dynamics

#### Study Points Acquisition

Students can earn study points by:

- Attending lectures
- Completing homework
- Studying in the library
- Engaging in practical exercises

#### Socialization

Characters can build relationships through activities:

- Eating at the mess hall _(easy, small benefit)_
- Grabbing coffee together _(small benefit)_
- Watching movies at the cinema _(moderate difficulty and benefit)_
- Hanging out at the pool _(moderately challenging, moderate benefit)_
- Picnicking in the park _(challenging, moderate benefit)_
- Beach trips _(most challenging, high benefit)_

#### Rest and Recreational Activities

To prevent burnout, students can:

- Read books
- Partake in hobbies
- Participate in club activities
- Engage in chaste handholding

Special considerations are given to individual preferences affecting decision outcomes, such as preferred or disliked activities impacting the willingness to participate.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Burnout Management**: A single meter may represent stamina and morale, balancing academic and social demands.
- **Planning Interface**: Players plan weekly activities that unfold in real-time, adapting to emergent scenarios and random events.
- **Duration**: Each playthrough is one week long, split into weekdays and weekends, offering a chance to assess and strategize for the coming weeks.

## The Upside

This simulator offers a unique blend of time management, relationship simulation, and supernatural elements that appeal to various gaming audiences.

## The Downside

Complex AI planning and character interaction mechanics could pose development challenges.

## The Road Not Taken

The decision to exclude a Pokemon-style battle system indicates a conscious move away from combat-oriented gameplay in favor of a simulation that emphasizes time management and social interactions within an academic setting. This choice differentiates the game from typical fantasy or RPG genres, focusing instead on daily life and relationship dynamics amongst magical girls.

Alternative paths that were not taken might include:

- Complex combat systems with magical abilities.
- An overarching narrative driven by external conflicts or villains.
- Expansion of the school's supernatural elements beyond academic settings into broader world-saving quests.

By not pursuing these elements, the game remains intimate, allowing players to deeply explore the nuances of daily decisions and their impacts on personal growth and friendships.

## The Infrequent Use Case

Though primary focus lies on managing relationships and academics within the college, rare use cases might involve:

- Handling exceptional magical crises that disrupt the normal flow of school life, requiring strategic changes to weekly planning.
- Special events such as magical tournaments or festivals, where characters must balance celebration with responsibilities.
- Unique narrative branches that only occur under specific conditions, adding replayability and depth to the character arcs.

Addressing infrequent use cases can add layers of complexity and engagement for players, offering surprises and challenges that disrupt the routine management aspects of the game.

## In Core and Done by Us?

The V-Sekai team will decide core features and their implementation internally.
