## The Backdrop

Virtual Reality (VR) is a rapidly growing technology with applications in various fields. One such application is the creation of virtual environments, such as apartments. This proposal aims to outline a strategy for building a cozy apartment in VR as a default environment for V-Sekai.

## The Challenge

The main challenge is to create a realistic and immersive virtual environment that accurately represents a cozy apartment. This includes creating detailed 3D models of the apartment's interior and exterior, as well as implementing realistic lighting and textures.

## The Strategy

1. Make a rough SVG sketch of the floor plan from the top for each of the topographical levels.
2. Convert SVG to geometry using a suitable software tool.
3. Use basic shapes to extrude the walls, floors, and ceilings of the apartment.
4. Check human dimensions to ensure the scale of the apartment is accurate and realistic.
5. Revise and refine the model in virtual reality.

## The Upside

Building a cozy apartment in VR can provide a unique and immersive experience for users. It can also be used for various purposes such as virtual tours, real estate marketing, and interior design planning.

## The Downside

The process of building a detailed and realistic VR apartment can be time-consuming and requires expertise in 3D modeling and VR technologies. Additionally, users will need VR equipment to fully experience the virtual apartment.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could have been to use pre-made 3D models of apartments. However, this would limit the customization options and may not provide the same level of detail and realism.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In cases where the VR apartment is used infrequently, it may not justify the time and resources spent on building it.

## In Core and Done by Us?

This project aligns with our core expertise in VR technologies and 3D modeling. Therefore, it can be done by us.
