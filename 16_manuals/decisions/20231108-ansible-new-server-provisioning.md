## The Backdrop

In the world of DevOps, server provisioning is a critical task. It involves setting up a server to a particular specification. This includes installing an operating system, software packages, and configuring settings.

## The Challenge

The challenge lies in choosing the right configuration management tool for a small project. Factors such as ease of use, scalability, and community support are crucial.

## The Strategy

Based on these parameters, **Ansible** emerges as a strong contender. Its simple syntax written in YAML makes it easy to understand even for those new to automation. Being agentless, it's easier to manage and scale. Moreover, Ansible has a large and active community, providing plenty of resources and support.

```python
# Sample Ansible playbook
---
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: ensure apache is at the latest version
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: latest
```

## The Upside

Choosing Ansible can simplify server provisioning due to its simplicity and ease of use. It doesn't require any special coding skills, making it accessible for beginners.

## The Downside

While Ansible is powerful and user-friendly, it may not be as feature-rich as some other tools like Chef or Puppet. However, for a small project, this might not be a significant concern.

## The Road Not Taken

Other tools like Chef, Puppet, and SaltStack were also considered. While they all have their strengths, they may not be as beginner-friendly as Ansible.

## The Infrequent Use Case

For complex infrastructures or specific use cases, other tools might be more suitable. It's always a good idea to try out different tools before making a decision.

## In Core and Done by Us?

The decision to use Ansible for server provisioning is proposed by V-Sekai.
