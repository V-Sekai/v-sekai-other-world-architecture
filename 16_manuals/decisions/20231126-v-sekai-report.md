## What is V-Sekai?

V-Sekai, pronounced vee-say-kai, is a collective of developers passionate about creating open-source VR technology. We aim to contribute to social VR and provide alternatives to proprietary engines like Unity and Unreal.

Despite challenges, we've grown into a global community committed to advancing open standards and open-source software for virtual worlds.

Our strategy focuses on providing comprehensive documentation and support to help users understand the platform better. We're also committed to investigating and resolving issues like the reported Linux build problem.

## Background

Over the past month, our team has been deeply involved in the Godot Engine conference in Munich, Germany. Our primary responsibility during this period has been to prepare for the upcoming launch of Godot Engine 4.2, to which we are contributing as part of the animation and 3D pipeline teams.

## Problem Statement

What state is V-Sekai in, and what can it do?

## Strategy

### Critical Issues

1. **Multiplayer Voice Chat:** The multiplayer voice chat feature in V-Sekai is broken.
2. **Menu Editing:** In V-Sekai, menus can't be edited in VR. They can only be edited on the desktop before entering a game.
3. **Default Avatar IK:** V-Sekai's default ik is currently twisted incorrectly.

### Successes

4. **Avatar Uploading and Downloading:** V-Sekai can upload from the editor and, download avatars, and load them into the game at runtime.
5. **World Uploading and Downloading:** V-Sekai can upload from the editor and, download worlds, and load them into the game at runtime.
6. **VR Mode Loading:** V-Sekai can successfully load in VR mode.

### Opportunities

7. **Contributions:** V-Sekai is actively looking for more contributions.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

Addressing these challenges can enhance the user experience, boost platform adoption, and collect crucial feedback for subsequent development.

**Cons:**

There may be underlying issues causing the Linux build problem that could take significant time and resources to resolve.

## Alternative Approach

An alternative approach could have been to ignore the user's query and continue with the current development roadmap. However, this would not foster a supportive community or encourage user engagement.

## Infrequent Use Case

While most users may not encounter the same issue as PLYSHKAüêß, addressing even infrequent use cases is essential to ensure a robust and user-friendly platform.

## Responsibility

Addressing this issue falls within our core responsibilities as the V-Sekai development team.
