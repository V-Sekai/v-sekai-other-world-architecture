# Proposed: Upload Creative Commons FBX Test Files for Enhanced LOD Optimization in V-Sekai

## Metadata

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Deciders**: V-Sekai
- **Tags**: FBX Test Files, LOD Optimization, V-Sekai, File Testing

## The Backdrop

V-Sekai is continually improving its VR environments and functionalities. A key aspect of this development is optimizing Level of Detail (LOD) to enhance performance without sacrificing visual quality.

## The Challenge

Current LOD optimization processes are facing issues, notably crashing when handling multi-gigabyte FBX to OBJ test cases. This limits the ability to effectively test and optimize large, complex models in V-Sekai.

## The Strategy

Propose uploading a suite of Creative Commons FBX test files, credited to bbqbarbhg, to provide a more comprehensive and challenging dataset for LOD optimization testing.

## The Upside

Having access to a diverse and complex set of FBX files will allow for more thorough testing and optimization of LOD algorithms, leading to improved performance and stability in handling large and detailed models in the V-Sekai environment.

## The Downside

The process of integrating and testing with these new files may require significant resources and time. Additionally, if the files are extremely large or complex, they may pose challenges in terms of storage and processing requirements.

## The Road Not Taken

Alternative approaches might involve optimizing the current LOD algorithms without the use of these specific test files, but this could limit the effectiveness of optimization efforts.

## The Infrequent Use Case

While primarily aimed at enhancing LOD optimization, these test files could also be useful for other aspects of V-Sekai's development, such as stress-testing the engine and other optimization tasks.

## In Core and Done by Us?

This initiative involves incorporating external resources (Creative Commons FBX files) into the core development and testing processes of V-Sekai, potentially requiring adjustments in testing protocols and optimization strategies.
